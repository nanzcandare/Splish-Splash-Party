## How to Get Direct Image Links from Google Drive

When you share a Google Drive folder, you'll need to convert the sharing links to direct image links that can be displayed on the website.

### Step 1: Share Your Google Drive Folder

1. Open your Google Drive folder with the photos
2. Right-click on the folder → "Share" → "Get link"
3. Set permissions to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Copy the link and share it

### Step 2: Get Individual Photo Links

For EACH photo in the folder:
1. Right-click on the photo → "Get link"
2. You'll get a link like: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view?usp=sharing`
3. Extract the FILE_ID (the part between `/d/` and `/view`)
4. Convert to direct link format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

**Example:**
- Original: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view?usp=sharing`
- File ID: `1ABC123xyz`
- Direct link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123xyz`

### Step 3: Provide the Information

Please share:
1. The Google Drive folder link (so I can see how many photos you have)
2. For each photo, provide:
   - Photo number (1-8)
   - File ID or full sharing link
   - Caption/description (e.g., "Niamh at the pool", "Khalev's birthday")

**Format:**
```
Photo 1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view?usp=sharing - "Niamh swimming"
Photo 2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DEF456abc/view?usp=sharing - "Khalev's splash"
Photo 3: ... and so on
```

### Alternative: I Can Extract the Links

If you share the folder link, I can guide you through:
1. Opening each photo
2. Getting the shareable link
3. Converting it to the direct format

Once you provide the links, I'll update the code automatically!
